# Nifek

Personal project to support all the tools I wanted to have available, tailored for me :D
Based on https://djangocentral.com/building-a-blog-application-with-django/

# Development setup

- **Run:** `podman-compose up` Launches the server locally. You might need to access `127.0.0.1` rather than `0.0.0.0` due to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting.

# Production setup

- TBD
